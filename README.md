# MagicLandExplorer
A console application that simulates exploring various destinations
within Magic Land. The application will read data from an external
JSON file containing information about different destinations,
rides, shows, and dining options in the park. Users should be able
to interactively explore the available categories and destinations
and view details about specific features using LINQ queries and delegates.
